def segment_to_fraction(distance):
    """
    Converts lengths of which the plane cuts the axes to fraction.

    Tries convert distance to closest nicest fraction with denominator less or
    equal than 10. It is
    purely for simplicity and clearance of learning purposes. Jenny: 'In typical
    courses students usually do not encounter indices any higher than 6'.

    If distance is not a number (numpy nan), it means that plane is parallel to
    axis or contains it. Inverted fraction to nan (nan is 1/0) = 0 / 1 is
    returned

    Generally (special cases):

    a) if distance is smaller than some constant, i.g. 0.01011,
    than fraction's denominator usually much greater than 10.

    b) Also, if student will set point on 0.66 -> 1/3, so it is 333 plane,
    But if he will slightly move the mouse and click on 0.65 -> it will be
    (16,15,16) plane. That's why we are doing adjustments for points coordinates,
    to the closest tick, tick + tick / 2 value. And now UI sends to server only
    values multiple to 0.05  (half of tick). Same rounding is implemented for
    unittests.

    But if one will want to calculate miller indices with exact coordinates and
    with nice fractions (which produce small Miller indices), he may want shift
    to new origin if segments are like S = (0.015, > 0.05, >0.05) - close to zero
    in one coordinate. He may update S to (0, >0.05, >0.05) and shift origin.
    In this way he can receive nice small fractions. Also there is can be
    degenerated case when S = (0.015, 0.012, >0.05) - if update S to (0, 0, >0.05) -
    it is a line. This case  should be considered separately. Small nice Miller
    numbers and possibility to create very small segments can not be implemented
    at same time).


    Args:
        distance: float distance that plane cuts on axis, it must not be 0.
        Distance is multiple of 0.05.

def miller(points):
    """
    Calculates Miller indices from points.

    Algorithm:

    1. Calculate normal vector to a plane that goes trough all points.

    2. Set origin.

    3. Create Cartesian coordinate system (Ccs).

    4. Find the lengths of segments of which the plane cuts the axes. Equation
       of a line for axes: Origin + (Coordinate_vector - Origin) * parameter.

    5. If plane goes trough Origin:

       a) Find new random origin: find unit cube vertex, not crossed by a plane.

       b) Repeat 2-4.

       c) Fix signs of segments after Origin shift. This means to consider
          original directions of axes. I.g.: Origin was 0,0,0 and became
          new_origin. If new_origin has same Y coordinate as Origin, then segment
          does not change its sign. But if new_origin has another Y coordinate than
          origin (was 0, became 1), than segment has to change its sign (it now
          lies on negative side of Y axis). New Origin 0 value of X or Y or Z
          coordinate means that segment does not change sign, 1 value -> does
          change. So new sign  is (1 - 2 * new_origin): 0 -> 1, 1 -> -1

    6. Run function that calculates miller indices from segments.

        List of points. Each point is list of float coordinates. Order of
        coordinates in point's list: x, y, z. Points are different!
